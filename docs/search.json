The scope of this class includes main forms of energy, major energy production, conversion, and consumption activities, and technology innovation and transition embedded in the energy systems. We’ll first discuss the theoretical and empirical knowledge base and data sources to understand the energy-environmental and climate problems. The class will then introduce the modeling tools and skills to analyze energy systems or individual energy projects so to understand energy systems and enable evidence-based decision making. This class encourage students to design research projects, using the modeling tools, and presenting results."

    "text": "Background\nOn August 16, President Biden Signed H.R. 5376, The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 into law. The law targets to reduce U.S. carbon emission by 40% compared to the 2005 level, but can it deliver? Energy systems analysis could help to answer such questions. Three notable groups have released energy and emissions models that have been widely cited by lawmakers, advocates and the press:\n\nThe REPEAT Project, an academic initiative that aims for data-driven climate policy at Princeton University, estimated the bill would cut emissions 42 percent of 2005 levels by 2030, or 27 percent without it.\nThe Rhodium Group, an economic and environment consulting firm, found that emissions would fall 31 to 44 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 under the “Inflation Reduction Act”, and decline 24 to 35 percent without the bill.\nEnergy Innovation, a climate and energy think tank, showed that emissions would fall 37 to 41 percent of 2005 levels by the end of the decade with the bill, compared to 24 percent without it."
