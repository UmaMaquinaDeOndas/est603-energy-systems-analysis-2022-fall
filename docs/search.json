The law targets to reduce U.S. carbon emission by 40% compared to the 2005 level, but can it deliver? Energy systems analysis could help to answer such questions. Three notable groups have released energy and emissions models that have been widely cited by lawmakers, advocates and the press:\n\nThe REPEAT Project, an academic initiative that aims for data-driven climate policy at Princeton University, estimated the bill would cut emissions 42 percent of 2005 levels by 2030, or 27 percent without it.\nThe Rhodium Group, an economic and environment consulting firm, found that emissions would fall 31 to 44 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 under the “Inflation Reduction Act”, and decline 24 to 35 percent without the bill.\nEnergy Innovation, a climate and energy think tank, showed that emissions would fall 37 to 41 percent of 2005 levels by the end of the decade with the bill, compared to 24 percent without it."

Now he has one-year’s system operation data, and please go through the following questions to discuss if this is a good investment for Mr. XYZ.\n\n\n\n\nLearn to use PVWatts to simulate the monthly and annual generation of a distributed PV system. Please use the below sysetm information: Location: 11794\nDC Systems Size(kW): 6.4\nAll other parameters use defalt numbers\nPlease compare your simulated monthly results with actual system daily generation data over a year, compare the monthly generation and annual generation and show the margin of error in each month and annual sum (1pt). Discuss the risks/uncertainties to use simulation results to make purchase desision (1pt)?\nCalculate the simple payback time (in years, no discounting) of the solar system assuming the following (0.5pt):\nSystem costs (including panel and installation): $14,000\nState tax rebate: 25% (with a maximam of $5,000) of system costs\nFed tax credit: 26% of system costs\nHousehold average monthly electricity payment before installation: $140\nHousehold monthly PV system connection fee (cost): $15\nWhat’s payback time without the State and Fed tax credit (0.5pt)?\nNow taking into acount of discounting:\nAnnual discounting rate: 5%\nMr. XYZ got bank loan to pay half of the systems costs: Annual Percentage Rate (4%). Monthly payment for two years.\nMr. XYZ would received the tax credit in April during the tax filing month the following year\nUse July 2021 as the baseline month.\nWhat’s the payback time (in months) (1pt)?\nBuilding on question 3 and now calculating the leverized cost of electricity of Mr. XYZ’s system (1pt) The system life time: 25 years\nAssume an annual system degradation rate: 1% (meaning each year its annual total generation is 1% less than previous year)\nComparing your results with PSEG Long Island’s residential electricity rate (on average 21.22 cents/kWh in 2020).\nNow think about more nuanced considerations when making intallation decisions (using simple payback time or describe qualitatively) if:\nMr. XYZ found that his roof is too old and he has to replace the roof before installation (cost: $11,000) (0.5pt)\nMr. XYZ noticed that a big tree nearby created too much shade for the panel and is debating if he should cut the tree down (cost: $3000, and will lose a loving green space) (0.5pt)\nMr. XYZ had checked with the insurance company that the attachment of PV would impact the insurance policy (0.5pt)\nMr. XYZ will potentially move and sell the house in two years, how will that impact the investment decision (0.5pt)\nMr. XYZ can sell extra electricity back to the grid as in California’s case (0.5pt)\nMr. XYZ can only bank extra generation and will pay market rate if generation can not cover consumption as in New York’s case (0.5pt)\n\n\n\n\nLearn to use NREL’s System Advisory Model (SAM) to do more nuanced simulations.\n\nDownlod the software\n\nFollow the instuction\n\nGet the weather data of nearest location\n\nUsing default parameters to simulate hourly generation\n\nTry to play with the specific parameters to get familiar with the software"

One plant never commerically opertaed and was decommisioned and the rate-payers are still paying the construction cost, while the other is offered to extend operation in the midist of California’s clean energy quest.\n\n\nQuestions\n\nHow long does it take for Long Island residents to pay off the construction and decommission of Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant? (Bad energy investment decisions has drastic consequences) (1pt)\n\nKey assumptions: LILCO attaches a 3 percent surcharge to LI electric bills for 30 years to pay off the nuclear facility’s approximately $6 billion price tag in 1989.\nResidential rates in 2020: 21.22 cents/kWh\nTotal electricity consumption in 2020: 20 TWh\nDistount rate: 4%\nAssuming the real value of total annual surchage stay the same. You can use 2020 as a base year, and convert the 6 billion price tag to 2020 value, and then divided by the 2020 total surchages.\n\nDiablo Canyon generated nearly 9 percent of Cailifornia’s electricity last year and roughly 15 percent of the state’s clean energy production. Diablo Canyon Power Plant is granted a 5 year extention beyond its scheduled shutter at 2025. What’s the LCOE of Diablo Canyon Power Plant in its extended operation period (2026-2030)? (1pt)\n\nKey assumptions: 1.4 billion forgivable loans\nNameplate capacity: 2,256 MW\nCapacity factor: 80%\nDistount rate: 4%\n\n\nFurther readings\nGet to understand what composites the 6 billion price tag, and what are the hidden costs?

    "text": "Water withdrawal vs. water consumption\n\nWithdrawal is the volume of water removed from a source\n\nConsumption is the volume of water withdrawn that is not returned to the source, i.e. it is evaporated or transported to another location. \nDischarge is the volume of water withdrawn that is returned to the source, often degraded by use (altered physically or chemically) and impacting water quality. \nWater withdrawals are, by definition, always greater than or equal to consumption and are, therefore, the first limit approached at an energy production facility when water availability is constrained. \nConsumptive use reduces the amount of water available to satisfy demands downstream and is an important consideration where water resources are strained to meet the needs of all users."
