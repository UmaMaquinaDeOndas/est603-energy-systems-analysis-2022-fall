## Sample analytic questions

-   If all fossil plants stop generating from 2023, how that will contribute to the climate mitigation?\
-   What needs to be included in New York State's scoping plan to achieve goals in the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act?\
-   What level of social cost of carbon should New York State use?\
-   How climate change would affect energy supply and demand?\

## Structural change

## Shale gas revolution

## Renewable costs

## Uncertainties

## Political feasibility

## Why a model in the first place

- Description  
- Explanation  
- Experimentation  
- Providing sources of analogy  
- Communication/Education  
- Providing focal objects or centerpiece for scientific dialogue  
- Thought experiment  
- Projection  


## Modeling for insights

- Model based on research questions  
- Model elements, structure, relations  
- Do not over-interpret  
- Do not misinterpret  
- "All models are wrong, but some are **useful**". Avoid useless models.

- Where to use model  
- How to build your model  
- What to say about your model  


## Summary

-   IAM framework and models to analyze energy, emissions, and climate impacts\
-   Understanding the evolution of climate policy instuments\
-   Learn the applicatons and limitations of social cost of carbon\
-   Climate change affects energy supply and demand
