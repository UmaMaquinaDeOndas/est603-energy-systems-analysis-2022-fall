## Sample analytic questions

- What are the co-benefits of energy transitions?  
- How EV will change the load?    
- What drives energy demand growth?  
- How climate change changes energy demand?   
- How to make reasonal assumptions about appliances stock turn over?  



## Summary

- Energy demand is shaped by dynamic factors: populations, GDP, technology, regulation, and human behavior   
- Understanding those drivers will help us learn the magnitude and shape of our demand  
- Load forecast integrates all insights to the show
