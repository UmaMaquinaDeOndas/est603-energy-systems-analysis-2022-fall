## AI capabilities



## Summary

-   AI and big data has transformed how we live, and how can we save the planet\
-   AI does not automatic add new insights, but it provide powerful tools to analyze increasingly available big data\
-   Learning those new tools and skills becomes necessary to work in the field\
-   The potential of using AI/big data to analyze our understanding of energy supply/demand and human behavior is enomorous.
