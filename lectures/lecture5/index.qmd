## Sample analytic questions

- How many solar/wind capacities are needed to meet global energy need?  
- How many coal can be saved/emissions can be mitigated if China's average coal power efficiency increased by 1 percentage point?    
- Why combined heat and power saves energy?  
- How long should government subsidies heatpump?  
- When can offshore wind achieve grid parity?  


## Three efficiencies 
- 1st law: actual, thermal efficiency  
- Carnot: maximum possible efficiency  
- 2nd law: comparing 1st and Carnot
