## Sample analytic questions

- How many solar/wind capacities are needed to meet global energy need?  
- How many coal can be saved/emissions can be mitigated if China's average coal power efficiency increased by 1 percentage point?    
- Why combined heat and power saves energy?  
- How to design the layout of solar/wind farms to improve production?    

## Thermodynamics 



## Laws of thermodynamics {.smaller}

- Zeroth law  
> If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.  
- First law  
> In a process without transfer of matter, the change in internal energy, $\Delta U$, of a thermodynamic system is equal to the energy gained as heat, $Q$, less the thermodynamic work, $W$, done by the system on its surroundings.
- Second law   
> Heat does not spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter body.  
- Third law  
> As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, all processes cease and the entropy of the system approaches a minimum value.

## Three efficiencies 
- 1st law: actual, thermal efficiency; $\eta_1 =\frac{W_{net}}{Q_{in}}=\frac{Q_{high}-Q_{low}}{Q_{high}}=1-\frac{Q_{low}}{Q_{high}} $
- Carnot: maximum possible efficiency; $\eta_c =\frac{W_{net}}{Q_{high}}=\frac{T_{high}-T_{low}}{T_{high}}=1-\frac{T_{low}}{T_{high}} $ (Kelvin)  
- 2nd law: comparing 1st and Carnot; $\eta_2 =\frac{\eta_1}{\eta_c}$

Where,  
$\rho$ = Density  (kg/m3)  
$A$ = Swept Area  (m2)  = $\pi r^2$  
$v$ = Wind Speed  (m/s)  
$P$ = Power (W)
